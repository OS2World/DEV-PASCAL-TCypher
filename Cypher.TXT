TCypher component
*****************

TCypher is a component that allows for simple string encryption/decryption.
The component allows for either setting a random key seed directly or to
set the key seed by way of a password/key string.
Component is based on code developed for a equivalent component in Delphi
by Gordon Bamber.

To install:
-----------
Unzip the component source in your component source directory (my
directory is "drv:\sibyl\Components\...".  Compile the source, then move
the Cypher.SPU to the Sibyl COMPNT directory.
In Sibyl, choose 'Component', then 'install'.  Go to the COMPNT directory 
and select 'Cypher.SPU'.  Select the TCypher component and click OK.
The TCypher component will appear in a tab labeled 'Custom'.  To change
the component location, edit the EXPORTS line in the source.

TCypher methods:
----------------
<none available>

TCypher properties:
-------------------
PlainStr - R/W, STRING.  Property is only settable during runtime and 
           allows setting a string to encrypt or reading a decrypted
           string.
CypherStr - R/W, STRING.  Property is only available during runtime and
            allows reading the encrypted string out or setting an 
            encrypted sting to decrypted (with proper key or keystr set).
Key - R/W, LONGINT.  Property is available during design and allows the 
      input of the encryption seed value/key.
KeyStr - R/W, STRING.  Propert is settable during design and allows a 
         key string to determine and create the key used to encrypt or
         decrypt with.
Version - Read only (not stored).  Property is available during design.  
          Property returns the current version of the TCypher component.

To use:
-------
Drop the tcypher component on form.  From the IDE, you can set the keystr
or key (note: setting key empties the keystr field, setting keystr sets 
the key field).
During runtime, assign a plain text string to the PlainStr property,
CypherStr will then fill in with the encrypted string of the plainstr
property (based on currently set key or keystr properties).  To decrypt,
set key or keystr to previous value, the set the CypherStr property with
the encrypted string.  Read the decrypted string from the PlainStr
property.
